How would you test a typical elevator?



Very open ended question.  Here's some stuff to look for.
Does the candidate acknowledge that there are vague requirements inherint in the question?  What does he or she do about them?
Basic test cases (push the button, does the door open, go to a floor, etc...)
Safety should be a concern here.  How does the elevator fail?
Boundary testing can be considered going from top to bottom.
