Ransom Notes
Given a string, "document," determine if a second string, "message," can be constructed using only the characters in "document."

Examples:
Input: mes = "scary note", doc = "a bunch of text from today's newspaper"
Output: True

Input: mes = "even scarier note", doc = "a bunch of text from today's newspaper"
Output: False    // doc does not have a 'v' or enough 'e's

Part 2: Ignore Spaces
Part 3: Consider upper and lower case letters to be the same.
PArt 4: (No Code) How do you with inputs of billions of characters?
