Write a function to determine whether or not a string is "Balanced."
A string is balanced if all pairs of parenthesies and brackets match up correctly.

For example.

()[] - Balanced
([]) - Balanced
()[  - Not Balanced






The best way to answer this problem is with a stack.  Traverse the string and push open characters
onto the stack.  When you see a close character, make sure it matches up with the item at the top
of the stack.  Also need to cover for the case where the stack still contains items after the string
has been traversed.  This is a good question to see how the candidate does with test cases because
there are a handful of edge cases.
